# Lecture 2 Prototype: Data Structures and Version Control

## üéØ Phase 1, Week 3-4 Deliverable: Advanced Content Integration

This prototype demonstrates the next evolution in the narrative-driven lecture format, successfully combining Python data structures with Git version control workflows in a cohesive learning experience that builds directly on Lecture 1 foundations.

## üìã Prototype Overview

### Content Integration Achieved
- **Primary Source (85%)**: Python data structures - lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples
- **Secondary Integration (90%)**: Git fundamentals and collaborative workflows  
- **Advanced Integration**: Real-world applications combining both concepts
- **Format Evolution**: Enhanced narrative structure with integrated workflow demonstrations

### Key Innovation: Professional Workflow Integration
Instead of treating data structures and version control as separate topics, this prototype creates an integrated experience where students learn both skills as complementary tools for professional data science development.
