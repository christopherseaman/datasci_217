## 🔄 Scalability Insights

### Successful Patterns Identified
1. **Context-First Integration**: Introduce skills in service of primary topic
2. **Progressive Complexity**: Build integration gradually, don't combine everything at once  
3. **Real-World Threading**: Every concept connected to data science applications
4. **Executable Documentation**: Code that teaches while enabling practice

### Combination Strategy Library
- **Natural Pairs**: Python + Command Line (Prototype demonstrated)
- **Future Candidates**: Data Structures + Version Control, NumPy + Pandas + Visualization
- **Integration Models**: 90-25-30 works well, could test 80-30-20 or 85-15-15

### Quality Assurance Framework
- All code must execute without errors
- Narrative must read smoothly end-to-end
- Learning objectives must be achievable in time allotted
- Assessment alignment must be explicit and testable
