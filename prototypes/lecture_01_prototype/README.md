# Lecture 1 Prototype: Python Fundamentals + Essential Command Line

## üéØ Phase 1, Week 2 Deliverable: Content Reorganization Prototype

This directory contains a **working prototype** of the new Notion-compatible, narrative-driven lecture format. It demonstrates the successful combination of original Lecture 1 content with essential command line concepts into a cohesive learning experience.

## üìã Prototype Overview

### Content Integration Achieved
- **Primary Source (90%)**: Original Lecture 1 - Python basics, variables, control structures, functions
- **Secondary Integration (25%)**: Lecture 2 - Environment setup, command line basics  
- **Tertiary Integration (30%)**: Selected CLI concepts from lectures 3, 4, and 9
- **Format Transformation**: Complete conversion to long-form narrative with embedded interactive code

### Key Innovation: Unified Learning Journey
Instead of separate "command line" and "Python" lectures, this prototype creates a single, integrated experience where students learn both skills in the context of data science workflows. Command line operations are introduced as tools that enhance Python development, not as isolated skills.
