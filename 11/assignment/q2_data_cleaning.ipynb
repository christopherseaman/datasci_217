    "\n",
    "Clean the dataset by handling missing data, outliers, validating data types, and removing duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Series Note:** For time series data, forward-fill (`ffill()`) is often appropriate for missing values since sensor readings are continuous. However, you may choose other strategies based on your analysis.\n",

    "**Content:** Cleaned dataset with same structure as original (same columns)\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "- Same columns as original dataset\n",
    "- Missing values handled (filled, dropped, or imputed)\n",
    "- Outliers handled (removed, capped, or transformed)\n",
    "- Data types validated and converted\n",
    "- Duplicates removed\n",
    "- **Sanity check:** Dataset should retain most rows after cleaning (at least 1,000 rows). If you're removing more than 50% of data, reconsider your strategy—imputation is usually preferable to dropping rows for this dataset.\n",

    "## Your Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Handle missing data** - Choose appropriate strategy (drop, forward-fill, impute) based on data characteristics\n",
    "2. **Detect and handle outliers** - Use IQR method or z-scores; decide whether to remove, cap, or transform\n",
    "3. **Validate data types** - Ensure numeric and datetime columns are properly typed\n",
    "4. **Remove duplicates**\n",
    "5. **Document and save** - Write detailed cleaning report explaining your decisions\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Decision Points\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Missing data:** Should you drop rows, impute values, or forward-fill? Consider: How much data is missing? Is it random or systematic? For time series, forward-fill is often appropriate.\n",
    "- **Outliers:** Are they errors or valid extreme values? Use IQR method or z-scores to detect, then decide: remove, cap, or transform. Document your reasoning.\n",
    "- **Data types:** Are numeric columns actually numeric? Are datetime columns properly formatted? Convert as needed.\n",

    "- [ ] Outliers addressed\n",
    "- [ ] Data types validated\n",
    "- [ ] Duplicates removed\n",
    "- [ ] All 3 artifacts saved: `q2_cleaned_data.csv`, `q2_cleaning_report.txt`, `q2_rows_cleaned.txt`\n",
