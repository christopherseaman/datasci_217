    "\n",
    "Create derived features, perform time-based aggregations, and calculate rolling windows for time series analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Series Note:** Rolling windows are essential for time series data. They capture temporal dependencies (e.g., 7-hour rolling mean captures short-term patterns). See **Lecture 09** for time series rolling window operations. For hourly data, common window sizes are 7-24 hours (capturing daily patterns). Use pandas `rolling()` method with `window` parameter to specify the number of periods.\n",

    "## Required Artifacts\n",
    "\n",
    "You must create exactly these 3 files in the `output/` directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `output/q4_features.csv`\n",
    "**Format:** CSV file\n",
    "**Content:** Dataset with all derived features added\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "- All original columns from Q3\n",
    "- All new derived features added as columns\n",
    "- **No index column** (save with `index=False`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `output/q4_rolling_features.csv`\n",
    "**Format:** CSV file\n",
    "**Content:** Dataset with rolling window features\n",
    "**Required Columns:**\n",
    "- Original datetime column\n",
    "- At least one rolling window calculation column (e.g., `water_temp_rolling_7h`, `air_temp_rolling_24h`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "- Must include at least one rolling window calculation\n",
    "- Rolling window names should be descriptive (e.g., `temp_rolling_7h` for 7-hour rolling mean)\n",
    "- **No index column** (save with `index=False`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example columns:**\n",
    "```csv\n",
    "Measurement Timestamp,wind_speed_rolling_7h,humidity_rolling_24h,pressure_rolling_7h\n",
    "2022-01-01 00:00:00,6.8,65.2,1013.5\n",
    "2022-01-01 01:00:00,6.9,65.3,1013.6\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The example shows rolling windows of predictor variables (wind speed, humidity, pressure), not the target variable. If you're predicting Air Temperature, do NOT create rolling windows of Air Temperature - this causes data leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. `output/q4_feature_list.txt`\n",
    "**Format:** Plain text file\n",
    "**Content:** List of new features created (one per line)\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "- One feature name per line\n",
    "- No extra text, just feature names\n",
    "- Include all derived features, rolling features, and categorical features created\n",

    "\n",
    "- [ ] Derived features created (differences, ratios, interactions, etc.)\n",
    "- [ ] Time-based aggregations performed (by hour, day, month, etc.) - optional but recommended\n",
    "- [ ] At least one rolling window calculation (rolling mean, rolling median, etc.)\n",
    "- [ ] Categorical features created (if applicable)\n",
    "- [ ] Feature list documented\n",
    "- [ ] All 3 required artifacts saved with exact filenames\n",

    "## Your Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create derived features** - Differences, ratios, interactions between variables (watch for division by zero)\n",
    "2. **Calculate rolling windows** - Use `.rolling()` on predictor variables to capture temporal patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "   ⚠️ **Data Leakage Warning:** Do not create ANY features that use your target variable - this includes rolling windows, differences, ratios, or interactions involving the target. For example, if predicting Air Temperature, do not create `air_temp * humidity` or `air_temp - wet_bulb`. Only derive features from other predictor variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create categorical features** - Bin continuous variables if useful (optional)\n",
    "4. **Check for infinity values** - Ratios can produce infinity; replace with NaN and handle appropriately\n",
    "5. **Document and save** - Remember to `reset_index()` before saving CSVs\n",

    "- **Rolling windows:** What window size makes sense? 7 hours? 24 hours? Consider the temporal scale of your data. For hourly data, 7-24 hours captures daily patterns.\n",
    "- **Time-based aggregations:** Aggregate by hour? Day? Week? What temporal granularity is useful for your analysis?\n",
