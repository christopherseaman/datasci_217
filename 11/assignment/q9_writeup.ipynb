    "- Main goal/question\n",
    "- Key finding in one sentence\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Phase-by-Phase Findings\n",
    "Document findings for each of the 9 phases:\n",
    "- **Phase 1-2 (Q1):** Exploration findings, data quality issues\n",
    "- **Phase 3 (Q2):** What was cleaned, how missing data/outliers were handled\n",
    "- **Phase 4 (Q3):** Datetime parsing, temporal features extracted\n",
    "- **Phase 5 (Q4):** Derived features created, rolling windows calculated\n",
    "- **Phase 6 (Q5):** Trends identified, seasonal patterns, correlations\n",
    "- **Phase 7 (Q6):** Train/test split approach, features selected\n",
    "- **Phase 8 (Q7):** Models trained, performance metrics, feature importance\n",
    "- **Phase 9 (Q8):** Final visualizations, summary of key findings\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Visualizations (at least 5 figures with captions)\n",
    "- Embed visualizations from your analysis\n",
    "- Each figure must have:\n",
    "  - Image embedded using: `![Figure N: Description](output/filename.png)`\n",
    "  - Caption explaining what the figure shows\n",
    "- Required visualizations:\n",
    "  - At least 2 time series plots (from Q1, Q5, or Q8)\n",
    "  - At least 3 additional plots (distributions, correlations, model performance, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Model Results\n",
    "- Performance metrics table (use markdown table format)\n",
    "- Feature importance discussion\n",
    "- Model interpretation (what do R², RMSE, MAE mean in context?)\n",
    "- Model comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Time Series Patterns\n",
    "- Trends over time (increasing/decreasing/stable)\n",
    "- Seasonal patterns (daily, weekly, monthly cycles)\n",
    "- Temporal relationships between variables\n",
    "- Any anomalies or interesting temporal features\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Limitations & Next Steps\n",
    "- Data quality issues that couldn't be fully addressed\n",
    "- Model limitations\n",
    "- Additional features that could be created\n",
    "- Additional analysis that would be valuable\n",
    "- How results could be validated or extended\n",
