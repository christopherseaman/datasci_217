    "## Required Artifacts\n",
    "\n",
    "You must create exactly these 3 files in the `output/` directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `output/q8_final_visualizations.png`\n",
    "**Format:** PNG image file\n",
    "**Content:** Final summary visualizations\n",
    "**Required visualizations (at least 2 of these):**\n",
    "1. **Model performance comparison:** Bar plot or line plot comparing R², RMSE, or MAE across models\n",
    "2. **Predictions vs Actual:** Scatter plot showing predicted vs actual values (with perfect prediction line)\n",
    "3. **Feature importance:** Bar plot showing top N features by importance\n",
    "4. **Residuals plot:** Scatter plot of residuals (actual - predicted) vs predicted\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "- Clear axis labels (xlabel, ylabel)\n",
    "- Title for each subplot\n",
    "- Overall figure title (optional but recommended)\n",
    "- Legend if multiple series shown\n",
    "- Saved as PNG with sufficient resolution (dpi=150 or higher)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `output/q8_summary.csv`\n",
    "**Format:** CSV file\n",
    "**Content:** Key findings summary table\n",
    "**Required columns:**\n",
    "- `Metric` - Metric name (e.g., \"R² Score\", \"RMSE\", \"MAE\")\n",
    "- One column per model (e.g., `Linear Regression`, `Random Forest`, `XGBoost`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "- Must include at least R², RMSE, MAE metrics\n",
    "- One row per metric\n",
    "- **No index column** (save with `index=False`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",

    "- XGBoost achieves lowest RMSE: 0.73°C\n",
    "\n",
    "FEATURE IMPORTANCE:\n",
    "- Most important feature: Air Temperature (importance: 0.6539)\n",
    "- Top 3 features account for 93.6% of total importance\n",
    "- Temporal features (hour, month) are highly important\n",
    "\n",
    "TEMPORAL PATTERNS:\n",
    "- Clear seasonal patterns in temperature data\n",
    "- Daily and monthly cycles are important predictors\n",

    "DATA QUALITY:\n",
    "- Dataset cleaned: 50,000 → 50,000 rows\n",
    "- Missing values handled via forward-fill and median imputation\n",
