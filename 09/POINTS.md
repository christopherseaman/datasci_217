# Time Series Analysis: Temporal Data and Trends

## Understanding Time Series Data

Time series data is characterized by observations collected over time, where the order and timing of observations matter. Unlike cross-sectional data, time series data has a natural temporal structure that we can exploit for analysis. Understanding this temporal structure is crucial for effective time series analysis.

- Time series data has temporal ordering that matters - the sequence of observations contains important information
- Observations are often dependent on previous values - today's stock price depends on yesterday's price
- Time series data often contains patterns like trends, seasonality, and cycles that can be identified and analyzed
- The key insight: time series analysis is about understanding how things change over time, not just what they are
- Real-world time series data is messy - missing values, irregular intervals, and outliers are common

## Types of Time Series

Different types of time series require different analytical approaches. Understanding the characteristics of your time series data helps you choose appropriate analysis methods and identify potential issues.

- Regular time series have fixed intervals (daily, hourly, monthly) - these are easiest to analyze and most common in practice
- Irregular time series have variable intervals (event-based) - these require special handling and interpolation techniques
- Seasonal time series have patterns that repeat over time - these require seasonal decomposition and adjustment
- Trending time series have long-term directional movement - these require trend analysis and detrending
- Stationary time series have statistical properties that don't change over time - these are ideal for many analytical methods

# Date and Time Data Types

Working with dates and times in Python requires understanding the datetime module and pandas' powerful time series capabilities. The key is knowing when to use Python's datetime objects versus pandas' time series features.

- Python's datetime module provides basic date and time functionality - use it for simple date arithmetic and formatting
- pandas' DatetimeIndex is optimized for time series analysis - it provides powerful indexing, resampling, and time-based operations
