## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd [repository-name]
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   python verify_setup.py
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Main Program
```bash
python main.py
```

Expected output:
```
[Show example of what the program outputs when run]
```

### Using Individual Functions
```python
from main import calculate_average, find_maximum

# Calculate average
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
avg = calculate_average(numbers)
print(f"Average: {avg}")  # Output: Average: 3.0

# Find maximum
max_val = find_maximum(numbers)
print(f"Maximum: {max_val}")  # Output: Maximum: 5
```

## Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_functions.py -v

# Run with coverage report
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=main --cov-report=html
```

### Test Results
[After completing the assignment, include a summary of test results]

```
================= test session starts =================
collected X items

tests/test_functions.py::test_calculate_average PASSED
tests/test_functions.py::test_find_maximum PASSED
tests/test_functions.py::test_count_occurrences PASSED
...

================= X passed in Y seconds =================
```

## Design Decisions

### Algorithm Choices
[Explain why you chose specific algorithms or approaches]

1. **For calculating averages:** I chose to use sum()/len() rather than iterating with a counter because it's more Pythonic and readable.

2. **For error handling:** I implemented comprehensive type checking to ensure functions fail fast with clear error messages.

### Edge Cases Handled
[List edge cases you considered and how you handled them]

- Empty lists: Raise ValueError with descriptive message
- Invalid input types: Raise TypeError with type information
- Null/None values: [Describe how you handle them]

## Performance Considerations

[Discuss any performance optimizations or considerations]

- **Time Complexity:** Most functions are O(n) where n is the input size
- **Space Complexity:** Minimal additional space used beyond input
- **Optimizations:** [Any specific optimizations you implemented]

## Known Issues and Limitations

[Be honest about any known issues or limitations]

- [Issue 1]: [Description and potential solutions]
- [Issue 2]: [Description and potential solutions]

## Future Improvements

[Suggest improvements you would make with more time]

- [ ] Add support for different number types (Decimal, Fraction)
- [ ] Implement parallel processing for large datasets
- [ ] Add configuration options for different behaviors
- [ ] Improve error messages with suggestions
