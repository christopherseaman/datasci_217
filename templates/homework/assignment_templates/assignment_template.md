## Requirements

### Part 1: [Requirement Title] (X points)

[Detailed description of what needs to be implemented]

**Function Signature:**
```python
def function_name(param1: type, param2: type) -> return_type:
    """
    Brief description of what the function does.
    
    Args:
        param1: Description of parameter 1
        param2: Description of parameter 2
    
    Returns:
        Description of return value
    
    Raises:
        SpecificError: When this error might occur
    """
    pass
```

**Requirements:**
- [ ] Implement the function according to the signature
- [ ] Handle edge cases (empty inputs, invalid types, etc.)
- [ ] Include proper error handling
- [ ] Add comprehensive docstrings
- [ ] Follow PEP 8 style guidelines

**Example Usage:**
```python
>>> result = function_name("example", 42)
>>> print(result)
Expected output here
```

### Part 2: [Requirement Title] (Y points)

[Continue with additional parts...]

## Testing Your Solution

### Running Tests Locally
```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_part1.py -v

# Run with coverage report
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=. --cov-report=html
```

### Understanding Test Output
- ‚úÖ **Green (PASSED)**: Test passed successfully
- ‚ùå **Red (FAILED)**: Test failed - check the error message
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  **Yellow (SKIPPED)**: Test was skipped (usually dependency issues)

### Test Categories
1. **Basic Tests**: Test core functionality
2. **Edge Cases**: Test boundary conditions and unusual inputs
3. **Error Handling**: Test proper exception handling
4. **Integration Tests**: Test how components work together

## Submission Guidelines

### What to Submit
Your repository should contain:
- [ ] `main.py` - Your main implementation
- [ ] `README.md` - Documentation of your solution
- [ ] `requirements.txt` - Dependencies (if you added any)
- [ ] Any additional modules you created

### Submission Process
1. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Complete homework assignment - [brief description]"
   ```

2. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Verify submission**:
   - Check that all files are visible on GitHub
   - Ensure the auto-grader runs successfully
   - Review the feedback in the Actions tab

### Late Submission Policy
[Insert course-specific late policy]

## Grading Rubric

| Category | Points | Criteria |
|----------|--------|----------|
| **Correctness** | [X] | Code produces correct outputs for all test cases |
| **Code Quality** | [Y] | Clean, readable code following Python conventions |
| **Error Handling** | [Z] | Appropriate handling of edge cases and errors |
| **Documentation** | [W] | Clear docstrings, comments, and README |
| **Testing** | [V] | All tests pass, good test coverage |

### Grade Breakdown
- **90-100%**: Exceptional work, exceeds expectations
- **80-89%**: Good work, meets all requirements
- **70-79%**: Satisfactory work, meets most requirements
- **60-69%**: Below expectations, missing key components
- **Below 60%**: Unsatisfactory, significant issues

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Module not found" error
**Solution**: Make sure you've installed all dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Issue: Tests are failing
**Solution**: 
1. Read the test error messages carefully
2. Check that your function signatures match exactly
3. Verify your return types and values
4. Test with the provided examples

### Issue: Auto-grader not running
**Solution**:
1. Check that you've pushed to the `main` branch
2. Verify all required files are present
3. Check the Actions tab for error messages

### Issue: Style/formatting warnings
**Solution**:
```bash
# Auto-format your code
black *.py

# Check for style issues
flake8 *.py
```
