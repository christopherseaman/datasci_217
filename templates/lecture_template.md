# Lecture {LECTURE_NUMBER}: {LECTURE_TITLE}

## Overview

{Brief narrative introduction that sets the context and explains why this topic matters in data science. This should be engaging and help students understand the "why" before diving into the "how".}

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:

- {Objective 1 - specific, measurable, actionable}
- {Objective 2}
- {Objective 3}

## Prerequisites

This lecture builds on concepts from previous lectures, specifically:

- {Prerequisite concept 1} (from Lecture X)
- {Prerequisite concept 2} (from Lecture Y)

## Core Concepts

### {Major Topic 1}

{Comprehensive narrative explanation of the concept. Use storytelling techniques to make abstract concepts concrete. Include real-world applications and examples that students can relate to.}

```python
# Code example that demonstrates the concept
# Include comments that explain not just what the code does,
# but why we're doing it this way
def example_function():
    """
    Brief description of what this function demonstrates.
    
    This function shows how to {specific technique}, which is
    important because {reason why it matters}.
    """
    pass
```

{Continue the narrative, explaining what the code accomplishes and connecting it back to the broader learning objectives.}

### {Major Topic 2}

{Another comprehensive section with narrative flow...}

## Hands-On Practice

### Exercise 1: {Exercise Name}

{Provide context for why this exercise matters and what specific skills it develops.}

```python
# Starter code or template
# Include clear instructions as comments
```

**Expected Outcome**: {Description of what students should achieve}

### Exercise 2: {Exercise Name}

{Another practical exercise...}

## Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

### Issue: {Common Problem Students Face}

**Symptoms**: {How students will recognize this problem}

**Solution**: {Step-by-step resolution}

**Why This Happens**: {Educational explanation of the underlying cause}

## Real-World Applications

{Connect the lecture content to actual data science workflows. Use specific examples from industry, research, or current events that demonstrate the relevance of what students are learning.}

## Assessment Integration

### Formative Assessment

Quick check questions that help students gauge their understanding:

1. {Question that tests basic comprehension}
2. {Question that tests application ability}
3. {Question that tests synthesis/analysis}

### Summative Assessment Preview

{Brief description of how this lecture's content will be assessed in assignments or exams, helping students focus their study efforts.}

## Further Reading and Resources

### Essential Resources
- {Resource 1 with brief explanation of why it's valuable}
- {Resource 2}

### Advanced Topics
- {Resource for students who want to go deeper}
- {Resource for advanced applications}

## Next Steps

In the next lecture, we will build on today's concepts by exploring {preview of next topic}. The skills you've learned today, particularly {specific skills}, will be essential for {specific application in next lecture}.
