# Data Loader for Assignment 10

This notebook loads the California Housing dataset used in the assignment.

**Note:** The assignment now uses the California Housing dataset from scikit-learn, which is automatically loaded in the assignment notebook. This data generator is kept for reference but is no longer needed.

```python
# The dataset is loaded directly in the assignment notebook using:
# from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing
# housing_data = fetch_california_housing(as_frame=True)
# df = housing_data.frame

print("California Housing dataset is loaded automatically in the assignment notebook.")
print("No separate data generation step is required.")
```
