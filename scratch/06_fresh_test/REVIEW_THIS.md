## 🔍 Quick Summary of Findings

### Top Issues Identified:

1. **Methods Beyond Lectures 01-06** ⚠️
   - `.dt.to_period('M')` - Period conversion not covered
   - `keys` parameter in concat - Hierarchical indexing too advanced
   - Horizontal concat alignment - Complex index concepts

2. **Unclear Instructions** 📝
   - Q1B: "Check for NaN values in purchase columns" - Which specific column?
   - Q3A: Period objects introduced but not explained
   - Multi-column merge rationale not clear

3. **Missing Conceptual Explanations** 🤔
   - When to use merge vs concat?
   - When to use pivot_table vs pivot?
   - Why create wide format then melt back to long?

4. **Assumed Prior Knowledge** 📚
   - File I/O with `open('w')` mode
   - Understanding axis=0 vs axis=1
   - Method chaining complexity

5. **No Sample Outputs** 👀
   - Can't verify intermediate steps
   - Pivot table format might surprise students
   - No way to check "am I on the right track?"

### Current Difficulty: 7/10 (Moderate-Hard)

**Time Estimates:**
- Fast students: 30 minutes
- Average students: 45-60 minutes
- Struggling students: 90+ minutes

### With Improvements: 5/10 (Moderate)
Perfect for week 6-7 of introductory course.

## 💡 Top Recommendations

### Priority 1: Critical Fixes
1. **Provide `.to_period()` code** in Q3A instead of making students write it
2. **Remove hierarchical indexing** (keys parameter in Q2A) or add full explanation
3. **Add column reference table** at top showing dataset structures
4. **Clarify NaN check** in Q1B - specify to check `purchase_id` column

### Priority 2: Important Enhancements
1. **Add sample outputs** for complex operations (pivot table, concat with keys)
2. **Explain merge vs concat** - when to use each
3. **Show axis parameter visually** - diagram of axis=0 vs axis=1
4. **Break down method chaining** - show intermediate steps
5. **Add "why melt?" explanation** - use cases for long vs wide format

### Priority 3: Nice to Have
1. Learning objectives at top of each question
2. Common mistakes warnings
3. Troubleshooting guide for errors
4. Optional challenge problems
5. Self-check assertions (`assert` statements)

## 📊 What Students Learn

### Skills Practiced:
- ✅ Loading and saving CSV files
- ✅ Merging datasets with different join types (inner, left)
- ✅ Vertical concatenation (stacking rows)
- ✅ Horizontal concatenation (adding columns)
- ✅ Pivot tables for reshaping wide
- ✅ Melting for reshaping to long format
- ✅ Groupby aggregations
- ✅ Data quality validation

### Confidence Growth:
- Merging: 3/10 → 8/10 (+5) 📈 Strong growth
- Join types: 2/10 → 7/10 (+5) 📈 Strong growth
- Vertical concat: 2/10 → 7/10 (+5) 📈 Strong growth
- Horizontal concat: 2/10 → 6/10 (+4) 📊 Moderate growth
- Pivot tables: 3/10 → 6/10 (+3) 📊 Moderate growth
- Melt/reshape: 2/10 → 5/10 (+3) 📊 Moderate growth

**Overall**: 3/10 → 7/10 (+4) 📈

## 🎯 Overall Assessment

**Grade**: **B+** (Very Good with Room for Improvement)

### Strengths:
- ✅ Progressive complexity (simple → complex)
- ✅ Real-world retail scenario is relatable
- ✅ Data generator ensures consistency
- ✅ Good hints in most TODOs
- ✅ Final verification checklist
- ✅ Practical workflow practice

### Areas for Improvement:
- ⚠️ Some methods go beyond lectures 01-06
- ⚠️ Need more "why" explanations, not just "how"
- ⚠️ Sample outputs would help verification
- ⚠️ Some instructions could be clearer
- ⚠️ Conceptual jumps in Q3

### Conclusion:
This is a **well-designed assignment** that effectively teaches data wrangling concepts. With the recommended improvements, it would be **excellent** for students who have completed lectures 01-06.

## 📞 Questions to Consider

As you review the documentation, consider:

1. **Are the methods used appropriate for lectures 01-06?**
   - See "Methods Not Covered" section in STUDENT_EXPERIENCE_REPORT.md

2. **Are the TODOs clear enough?**
   - See specific confusion points in each question section

3. **Is the difficulty appropriate?**
   - Current 7/10 might be too hard for some students

4. **Should hierarchical indexing be removed?**
   - The `keys` parameter in concat is quite advanced

5. **Do students need sample outputs?**
   - Would help them verify they're on track
