## Key Findings from Student Experience

### Top 5 Issues for Students:

1. **Methods Beyond Lectures 01-06** ⚠️
   - `.dt.to_period('M')` - Period conversion not covered
   - `keys` parameter in concat - Hierarchical indexing too advanced
   - Horizontal concat alignment - Complex index concepts

2. **Unclear TODO Instructions** 📝
   - Part 1B: "Check for NaN values in purchase columns" - Which column?
   - Part 3A: Period objects not explained
   - Multi-column merge rationale not clear

3. **Missing Conceptual Explanations** 🤔
   - Why use merge vs concat?
   - When to use pivot_table vs pivot?
   - Why convert to long format after creating wide format?

4. **Assumption of Prior Knowledge** 📚
   - File I/O with `open('w')` mode
   - Understanding of axis=0 vs axis=1
   - Method chaining complexity

5. **No Expected Output Samples** 👀
   - Students can't verify they're on the right track
   - Intermediate results not shown
   - Pivot table format might surprise students

## What Worked Well

### Excellent Design Elements:
1. ✅ **Progressive complexity** - Builds from simple to complex
2. ✅ **Real-world scenario** - Retail purchases relatable
3. ✅ **Data generator** - Everyone has identical data
4. ✅ **Helpful hints** - Most TODOs have guidance
5. ✅ **Validation checklist** - Final verification cell
6. ✅ **Practical workflow** - Load → merge → analyze → save

### Strong Pedagogical Features:
- Compare join types (inner vs left) side-by-side
- Show same operation with different parameters (concat with/without keys)
- Build on previous results (Q3 loads Q1's output)
- Real data quality issues (NaN values from imperfect joins)

---

## Specific Improvement Recommendations

### Priority 1: Critical Fixes
1. **Provide `.to_period()` code** in Q3A instead of making students figure it out
2. **Remove hierarchical indexing** (keys parameter) from Q2A or add full explanation
3. **Add column reference table** showing all dataset structures
4. **Clarify NaN check instruction** in Q1B (specify which column)

### Priority 2: Important Enhancements
1. **Add expected output samples** for complex operations
2. **Explain merge vs concat** decision-making
3. **Show axis parameter visually** with diagram
4. **Break down method chaining** into intermediate steps
5. **Add "why melt?" explanation** with use cases

### Priority 3: Nice to Have
1. Add learning objectives at top of each question
2. Include common mistakes warnings
3. Provide troubleshooting guide
4. Add optional challenge problems
5. Create assert statements for self-checking

## Methods Coverage Analysis

### ✅ Fully Covered in Lectures 01-06:
- `pd.read_csv()`, `.to_csv()`
- `pd.merge()` basic syntax
- `.head()`, `.info()`, `.describe()`
- Boolean filtering
- `.groupby()` basics
- `.round()`, `.sum()`, `.mean()`

### ⚠️ Covered but Need Practice:
- `how` parameter in merge (inner/left/right/outer)
- `aggfunc` in pivot_table
- `.agg()` with multiple functions
- `ignore_index` in concat
- `.set_index()` usage

### ❌ NOT Covered in Lectures 01-06:
- `.dt.to_period('M')` - Period objects
- `keys` parameter - Hierarchical indexing
- `axis` parameter deep understanding
- Horizontal concat with index alignment
- Multi-level index interpretation

## Difficulty Assessment

### Current Difficulty: 7/10 (Moderate-Hard)

**Time Estimates:**
- Fast students: 30 minutes
- Average students: 45-60 minutes
- Struggling students: 90+ minutes

### Breakdown by Question:
- **Q1 (Merging)**: 5/10 - Straightforward with good hints
- **Q2 (Concatenating)**: 7/10 - Axis and keys parameters confusing
- **Q3 (Reshaping)**: 8/10 - Period objects and concept jumps challenging

### With Recommended Improvements: 5/10 (Moderate)
- Appropriate for week 6-7 of intro course
- Challenging but achievable with scaffolding
- Good balance of guidance and exploration

## Student Confidence After Completion

Based on working through as a student:

| Skill | Before | After | Confidence |
|-------|--------|-------|------------|
| Merging datasets | 3/10 | 8/10 | 📈 Strong growth |
| Join types | 2/10 | 7/10 | 📈 Strong growth |
| Vertical concat | 2/10 | 7/10 | 📈 Strong growth |
| Horizontal concat | 2/10 | 6/10 | 📊 Moderate growth |
| Pivot tables | 3/10 | 6/10 | 📊 Moderate growth |
| Melt/reshape | 2/10 | 5/10 | 📊 Moderate growth |
| Overall workflow | 3/10 | 7/10 | 📈 Strong growth |

**Overall Assessment**: Assignment successfully teaches core concepts but leaves some advanced topics (Period, hierarchical index) feeling incomplete.

## Final Recommendation

### For Instructors:
**Use this assignment**: Yes, with minor modifications
**Best timing**: Week 6-7 after covering merge/concat/reshape
**Estimated class time**: 60-90 minutes in lab setting
**Support needed**: TA availability for Period objects and axis questions

### Suggested Pre-Assignment:
1. Quick review of file I/O in Python
2. Visual explanation of axis=0 vs axis=1
3. Demo of .head() workflow for exploring data
4. Overview of wide vs long format use cases

### Suggested Post-Assignment:
1. Class discussion of when to use merge vs concat
2. Practice problems with different join types
3. Extension: Add outer join and cross join examples
4. Real dataset exploration using same techniques

## Conclusion

✅ **Assignment completed successfully**
✅ **All 5 required output files generated**
✅ **Comprehensive student experience documented**
✅ **Clear improvement recommendations provided**

This assignment is **effective for teaching data wrangling** but would benefit from:
1. More scaffolding for advanced concepts
2. Clearer explanations of "why" not just "how"
3. Sample outputs for verification
4. Removal or better explanation of methods beyond lectures 01-06

**Overall Grade**: B+ (Very Good with Room for Improvement)
