# Demo 1: NumPy Performance - Why NumPy Matters

**Script:** `01_numpy_performance_demo.py`

**Purpose:** Demonstrates the fundamental performance advantage of NumPy over Python lists.

**Lecture Connection:** Shows why NumPy is essential for data science through concrete performance measurements.

## Instructions

### Run the Performance Demo

```bash
python 01_numpy_performance_demo.py
```
