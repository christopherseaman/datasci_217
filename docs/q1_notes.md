# Question 1 - Project Setup Script: Implementation Notes

## Task Completion Summary

**Status:** ✅ Complete and tested

The script successfully:
1. Creates three directories: `data/`, `output/`, `reports/`
2. Generates clinical trial dataset using `generate_data.py`
3. Saves directory structure to `reports/directory_structure.txt` using `tree` command

## What Was Straightforward

All requirements were straightforward and directly covered in lectures 1-2:

### Bash Scripting Basics (Lecture 1)
- **Shebang**: `#!/bin/bash` - Standard bash script header
- **Echo statements**: Used for user feedback throughout script
- **Directory creation**: `mkdir -p` command with multiple directories
- **Script execution**: `chmod +x` and running with `./script.sh`

### Running Python Scripts (Lecture 2)
- **Python execution**: `python3 generate_data.py` - Direct command execution
- **Command chaining**: Implicit sequential execution in bash script

### Advanced Features Implemented (Lecture 2)
- **Conditional execution**: `if command -v tree` to check for command availability
- **Fallback logic**: Uses `ls -R` if `tree` is not available
- **Output redirection**: `>` operator to save command output to file
- **Error handling**: `&> /dev/null` to suppress command existence check output

## Script Structure

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Comments explaining purpose
echo "User feedback"
mkdir -p data output reports  # Multiple directories at once
python3 generate_data.py      # Python script execution
tree > reports/directory_structure.txt  # Output redirection
```

## Unclear Instructions

**None.** All instructions were clear and requirements were explicit:
- Directory names specified exactly
- Python script name provided
- Output file location given
- All commands covered in lectures

## Methods/Techniques Coverage

All methods used were covered in lectures 1-2:

| Method | Lecture | Coverage |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `#!/bin/bash` | Lecture 1 | Shebang for bash scripts |
| `mkdir -p` | Lecture 1 | Create directories with parents |
| `echo` | Lecture 1 | Print to console |
| `python3` | Lecture 2 | Execute Python scripts |
| `tree` command | Lecture 2 | Display directory structure |
| Output redirection `>` | Lecture 2 | Save command output to file |
| Command existence check | Lecture 2 | `command -v` pattern |
| Conditional statements | Lecture 2 | `if/then/else/fi` structure |

## Testing Results

Script tested successfully:
- ✅ All directories created (`data/`, `output/`, `reports/`)
- ✅ Dataset generated at `data/clinical_trial_raw.csv` (958 KB, 10,000 patients)
- ✅ Directory structure saved to `reports/directory_structure.txt`
- ✅ Script is executable with proper permissions
- ✅ User feedback messages display correctly

## Additional Notes

### Defensive Programming
The script includes good defensive programming practices:
- Uses `mkdir -p` to avoid errors if directories exist
- Checks for `tree` command availability before use
- Provides fallback to `ls -R` if `tree` not available
- Includes clear echo messages for user feedback

### Script Output
```
Setting up project directories...
Directories created successfully
Generating clinical trial dataset...
Dataset generated successfully
Saving directory structure...
Directory structure saved to reports/directory_structure.txt
Project setup complete!
```

## Pedagogical Assessment

This question effectively reinforces:
1. **Basic bash scripting** - shebang, commands, structure
2. **Directory management** - creating organized project structure
3. **Python integration** - running Python scripts from bash
4. **Output redirection** - capturing command output to files
5. **Error handling** - checking command availability

All techniques are foundational and appropriate for a data science course introducing shell scripting and project organization.

**Conclusion:** Question 1 is well-designed scaffolding that requires only techniques covered in lectures 1-2. No gaps in lecture coverage were identified.
