# DataSci 217: Course Overview

## Course Structure

The course offers two tracks to accommodate different student backgrounds and time commitments:

### 5-Lecture Intensive Track
- **Target Audience**: Students with some programming experience, bootcamp graduates, career changers
- **Prerequisites**: Basic computer literacy, familiarity with at least one programming language
- **Time Commitment**: 5 weeks × 3.5 hours = 17.5 contact hours + 25 hours independent work
- **Outcome**: Core data science competency for immediate application

### 10-Lecture Extended Track
- **Target Audience**: Complete beginners, traditional academic progression, comprehensive preparation  
- **Prerequisites**: Basic computer literacy only
- **Time Commitment**: 10 weeks × 4 hours = 40 contact hours + 50 hours independent work
- **Outcome**: Professional-level data science skills with advanced applications

**Detailed Structure:**
1. **Command Line & Development Environment** (4h)
2. **Git Mastery & Collaboration** (4h)  
3. **Automation & Remote Computing** (4h)
4. **Python Programming Fundamentals** (4h)
5. **File Operations & Error Handling** (4h)
6. **NumPy & Scientific Computing** (4h)
7. **Pandas Mastery & Data Manipulation** (4h)
8. **Advanced Visualization & Design** (4h)
9. **Statistical Analysis & Machine Learning** (4h)
10. **Professional Workflows & Integration** (4h)

## Implementation Status

The course redesign infrastructure is fully implemented:
- Templates and conversion tools available
- Backup of original materials complete
- New format standards established
- Documentation and guidelines prepared

## Implementation Resources

### Available Materials
- **5-Lecture Content**: Complete materials in `/docs/5_lecture_intensive/`
- **Templates**: Lecture and demo templates in `/templates/`
- **Conversion Scripts**: Automation tools in `/scripts/`
- **Original Backup**: All original content preserved in `/lectures_bkp/`
- **Format Guidelines**: Standards and conversion guides in `/docs/format_guidelines/`

### Quick Start Commands
```bash
# Convert single lecture
python scripts/convert_lecture.py [lecture_number]

# Batch convert all lectures  
python scripts/batch_convert.py

# Verify backup integrity
python scripts/verify_backup.py
```

### Infrastructure Status
- ✅ Complete backup of 349 files verified
- ✅ Conversion pipeline tested and operational
