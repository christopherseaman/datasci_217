# Assignment 5: Data Cleaning and Preparation

## Overview

In this assignment, you'll practice essential data cleaning and preparation techniques using pandas. You'll work with a messy dataset containing various data quality issues and apply systematic cleaning methods to prepare it for analysis.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this assignment, you will:
- Identify and handle missing data appropriately
- Clean and standardize text data
- Detect and handle outliers
- Convert data types correctly
- Validate data quality
- Create a comprehensive data cleaning pipeline

## Dataset

You'll work with a dataset containing information about employees at a fictional company. The dataset includes various data quality issues:
- Missing values in multiple columns
- Inconsistent text formatting
- Outliers in numeric columns
- Incorrect data types
- Duplicate records
- Inconsistent categorical values

## Assignment Tasks

### Task 1: Data Quality Assessment (20 points)

1. Load the dataset and perform a comprehensive data quality assessment
2. Identify missing values, duplicates, and data type issues
3. Create a data quality report with statistics and visualizations
4. Document all data quality issues found

### Task 2: Missing Data Handling (25 points)

1. Analyze patterns in missing data
2. Implement appropriate strategies for handling missing values
3. Justify your approach for each column
4. Create visualizations showing before/after missing data handling

### Task 3: Text Data Cleaning (20 points)

1. Clean and standardize text columns (names, addresses, descriptions)
2. Handle inconsistent formatting and encoding issues
3. Extract useful information from text fields
4. Validate text data quality

### Task 4: Outlier Detection and Handling (15 points)

1. Detect outliers in numeric columns using multiple methods
2. Implement appropriate outlier handling strategies
3. Justify your approach for each column
4. Create visualizations showing outlier detection results

### Task 5: Data Validation and Export (20 points)

1. Implement comprehensive data validation rules
2. Create a data quality monitoring system
3. Export the cleaned dataset
4. Generate a final data quality report

## Requirements

- Use Jupyter notebook for this assignment
- Include markdown cells to explain your approach
- Use appropriate pandas methods for each task
- Handle errors gracefully
- Comment your code appropriately
- Create visualizations for data quality assessment

## Submission

Submit your completed Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file) with:
- All code cells executed
- Clear explanations in markdown cells
- Data quality visualizations
- Summary of cleaning steps performed
- Final data quality report

## Grading Criteria

- **Code Quality (30%)**: Clean, readable, and well-commented code
- **Correctness (40%)**: Accurate implementation of cleaning techniques
- **Documentation (20%)**: Clear explanations and markdown cells
- **Insights (10%)**: Meaningful analysis and conclusions

## Tips

- Start with a comprehensive data quality assessment
- Document your cleaning decisions
- Use multiple methods for outlier detection
- Validate your results after each cleaning step
- Create visualizations to support your analysis
- Test your cleaning pipeline with edge cases
