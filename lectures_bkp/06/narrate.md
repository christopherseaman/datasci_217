- These operations are key to preparing data for modeling

## Slide 17: Concatenating DataFrames
- Concatenation is like stacking datasets together
- We use this when data is split across multiple files or tables
- It's useful for combining data from different time periods or sources
- Be careful to ensure the data aligns correctly when concatenating

## Slide 18: Merging DataFrames
- Merging combines datasets based on common information
- It's similar to joining tables in a database
- We use this to bring together related data from different sources
- The key is identifying the right columns to merge on

## Slide 19: Types of Joins
- Different types of joins give us flexibility in how we combine data
- Inner join keeps only matching data
- Outer join keeps all data, filling in missing values
- Left and right joins keep all data from one side
- Choose based on what data you need to retain

## Slide 20: Reshaping Data: Melt
- Melting transforms wide data into long format
- This is useful when we have multiple columns that represent the same type of data
- It creates a more compact representation of the data
- Melting often makes data easier to analyze or visualize

## Slide 21: Reshaping Data: Pivot
- Pivoting is the opposite of melting - it goes from long to wide format
- Use this when you want to spread out values into multiple columns
- It's helpful for creating summary tables or preparing data for certain analyses
- Think of it as restructuring your data to answer specific questions

## Slide 22: Stacking and Unstacking
- Stacking and unstacking are ways to reshape hierarchical data
