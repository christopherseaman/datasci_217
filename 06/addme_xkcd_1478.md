# xkcd 1478: P-Values

**URL:** https://xkcd.com/1478/

**Title:** P-Values

**Relevance to Lecture 06 (Data Wrangling):**
About statistical significance and data fishing - relevant when discussing grouping, aggregation, and finding patterns in data. The joke is about researchers trying different groupings until they find "significant" results.

**Suggested placement:**
- Near GroupBy/Aggregation section
- When discussing cross-tabulation or pivot tables
- As a warning about p-hacking when exploring grouped data

**Alt text:** "If all else fails, use 'significant at a p>0.05 level' and hope no one notices."
