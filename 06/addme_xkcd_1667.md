**URL:** https://xkcd.com/1667/

**Title:** Algorithms

**Relevance to Lecture 06 (Data Wrangling):**
About manual data cleaning and the "human algorithm" - sorting by hand. Relevant when discussing merge/join operations and data reshaping.

**Suggested placement:**
- When covering merge and join operations
- When discussing data transformation complexity
- Intro to data wrangling section

**Alt text:** "I swear, if I have to manually sort one more list of integers before I can use binary search on it, I'm going toâ€”oh, dammit, they're strings."
