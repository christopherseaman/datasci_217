# Data Wrangling Demo Guide

## Overview
Hands-on practice with the three fundamental data wrangling operations: merging datasets, concatenating DataFrames, and reshaping data formats.

## Demo Structure

### Demo 1: Merge Operations
**File**: `demo1_merge_operations.ipynb`
**Duration**: 20 minutes
**Focus**: Database-style joins with customer, product, and purchase data

**Key Activities**:
- Inner, left, right, and outer joins
- Multi-column merges
- Handling duplicate keys

### Demo 2: Pivot and Melt Operations
**File**: `demo2_pivot_melt.ipynb`
**Duration**: 20 minutes
**Focus**: Converting between wide and long data formats

**Key Activities**:
- Wide to long conversion with `melt()`
- Long to wide conversion with `pivot()`
- Analysis on long format data

### Demo 3: Concatenation and Index Management
**File**: `demo3_concat_timeseries.ipynb`
**Duration**: 20 minutes
**Focus**: Combining time series data and managing indexes

**Key Activities**:
- Vertical and horizontal concatenation
- Index management strategies
- Time series data handling
