# Data Aggregation Demo Guide

## Overview
Hands-on practice with data aggregation operations: groupby operations, pivot tables, remote computing, and performance optimization.

## Demo Structure

### Demo 1: GroupBy Operations
**File**: `demo1_groupby_operations.ipynb`
**Duration**: 25 minutes
**Focus**: Split-apply-combine paradigm and aggregation functions

**Key Activities**:
- Basic groupby operations and aggregation
- Transform, filter, and apply operations
- Hierarchical grouping and MultiIndex

### Demo 2: Pivot Tables and Cross-Tabulations
**File**: `demo2_pivot_tables.ipynb`
**Duration**: 25 minutes
**Focus**: Multi-dimensional data analysis

**Key Activities**:
- Pivot table creation and customization
- Cross-tabulation analysis
- Advanced pivot operations

### Demo 3: Remote Computing and Performance
**File**: `demo3_remote_performance.ipynb`
**Duration**: 25 minutes
**Focus**: Large dataset handling and optimization

**Key Activities**:
- SSH and remote computing setup
- Performance optimization techniques
- Parallel processing with large datasets

## Learning Objectives
- Master the split-apply-combine paradigm
- Create pivot tables for multi-dimensional analysis
- Use remote computing for large datasets
- Optimize performance for aggregation operations
- Apply advanced groupby techniques

## Required Materials
- Python environment with pandas, numpy
- Sample datasets (sales, customer, product data)
- Jupyter notebook interface
