# Assignment 04: Command Line Text Processing and Python Functions

## Overview
This assignment tests your ability to use command line text processing tools and create reusable Python functions for data analysis workflows.

## Learning Objectives
- Master CLI text processing tools (grep, cut, sort, uniq, pipes)
- Design effective Python functions for data processing
- Integrate CLI and Python tools in workflows
- Build reusable utility functions

## Assignment Structure

### Part 1: CLI Text Processing (40 points)
Use command line tools to process and analyze provided datasets.

**Tasks:**
1. **Data filtering with grep** (10 points)
   - Extract specific patterns from log files
   - Create filtered datasets based on criteria

2. **Column extraction with cut** (10 points)
   - Process CSV files to extract relevant columns
   - Handle different delimiter types

3. **Data sorting and deduplication** (10 points)
   - Sort data by multiple criteria
   - Remove duplicates and count frequencies

4. **Pipeline construction** (10 points)
   - Build complex data processing pipelines
   - Combine multiple CLI tools effectively

### Part 2: Python Functions (40 points)
Create reusable Python functions for data processing tasks.

**Tasks:**
1. **Data validation functions** (15 points)
   - Input validation and type checking
   - Error handling and reporting

2. **Text processing utilities** (15 points)
   - String cleaning and normalization
   - Pattern extraction functions

3. **File processing functions** (10 points)
   - Read and write data files
   - Handle different file formats

### Part 3: Integration Project (20 points)
Combine CLI and Python tools to solve a real-world data problem.

**Tasks:**
1. **Hybrid workflow implementation** (20 points)
   - Use CLI tools for preprocessing
   - Apply Python functions for analysis
   - Generate formatted output

## Files Provided
- `data/`: Sample datasets for processing
- `starter_code.py`: Template functions to complete
- `test_assignment.py`: Automated tests for validation

## Submission Requirements
- Complete all functions in `starter_code.py`
- Ensure all tests pass (`pytest test_assignment.py`)
- Include CLI commands used in `cli_commands.txt`
- Add brief explanations in code comments

## Grading Criteria
- **Functionality** (60%): Code works correctly and passes tests
- **Code Quality** (25%): Clean, readable, well-documented code
- **CLI Integration** (15%): Effective use of command line tools

## Due Date
