# DataSci 217 Implementation Plan - UPDATED REQUIREMENTS

## Project Objective (REVISED)
Reorganize DataSci 217 from existing content into a coherent 11-lecture sequence:
- **Lectures 1-5**: Complete foundational toolkit (1-unit completion option)  
- **Lectures 6-11**: Advanced mastery and professional skills (2-unit completion)
- **Target**: 11 lectures total (01-11, no lecture 12)
- **Method**: Evidence-based analysis focusing on practical utility and daily data science tools

---

## Current Status: REQUIRES REVISION

Previous work completed 10-lecture sequence, but requirements specify 11 lectures with enhanced structure.

---

## üîç **UPDATED SWARM ASSESSMENT FINDINGS**

### **Current State Analysis**:
- **lectures_bkp/**: Original slide-format content (7,474 total lines) - needs load reduction
- **lectures_inter/**: Strong narrative content L01-L09, L10 removed per instructor preference  
- **Content Load Analysis**: L07 (1,227 lines), L09 (917 lines), L11 (1,006 lines) are heaviest

### **Load Reduction Strategy**:
- **Git Simplification**: Focus on VS Code/GitHub GUI, move command line git to bonus
- **Content Streamlining**: Heavy topics to bonus sections within lectures
- **Practical Focus**: Emphasize daily data science tools, reduce theoretical content

### **Gap Analysis Against Requirements**:

#### ‚ùå **Priority Updates Needed**:
1. **Load Reduction**: Student overwhelm concern - need strategic content reduction
2. **Git Approach**: Shift from command line to VS Code/GitHub GUI focus
3. **Lecture Structure**: 11 lectures (01-11) with lectures_inter/10 excluded
4. **Bonus Content**: Move heavy/advanced topics to lecture-associated bonus sections
5. **Book References**: Update with McKinney, Shotts, MIT Missing Semester attribution

#### ‚úÖ **Strong Foundation Available**:
- Quality narrative content in lectures_inter/ (L01-L09)
- Clinical research content (lectures_bkp/L11) for final lecture
- Good practical focus already established  
- Existing assignment frameworks to build upon
