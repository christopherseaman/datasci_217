- **Bonus Content**: 200-400 lines per bonus section
- **Total Reduction**: ~30% content moved to bonus
- **Focus Shift**: Theory → practical applications

### **Load Distribution After Reduction**
```
L01: 400 lines core + 200 lines bonus (shell scripting)
L02: 450 lines core + 300 lines bonus (git command line)
L03: 400 lines core + 150 lines bonus (advanced file ops)
L04: 450 lines core + 250 lines bonus (linear algebra theory)
L05: 500 lines core + 200 lines bonus (advanced pandas)

## 🎨 **GUI-FIRST APPROACH IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Git Strategy Revolution**
**Traditional Approach** (command line heavy):
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push origin main
git branch feature
git checkout feature
git merge main
```

**NEW GUI-First Approach**:
1. **VS Code Integration**: Built-in source control panel
2. **GitHub Web Interface**: Online repository management
3. **Command Line → Bonus**: Advanced git in bonus sections only
4. **Collaboration**: Web-based pull requests, issues, project boards

### **Tool Priority Hierarchy**
1. **Primary**: VS Code, GitHub web interface, GUI tools
2. **Secondary**: Command line when GUI insufficient (bonus content)
3. **Advanced**: Complex command line workflows (bonus only)

### **Student Benefits**
- Lower barrier to entry
- Visual understanding of version control concepts  
- Practical collaboration skills
- Command line available for advanced users
