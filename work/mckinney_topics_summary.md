## McKinney vs Lecture Integration Notes

**McKinney Strengths:**
- Systematic progression from basics to advanced
- Comprehensive coverage of pandas ecosystem
- Strong practical examples
- Good balance of theory and application

**Integration Considerations:**
- McKinney assumes Jupyter notebook environment
- Less emphasis on command line integration
- Minimal git/collaboration coverage
- Limited debugging instruction
- No CLI-first approach

**Recommended Adaptations:**
1. Start CLI-first, introduce Jupyter later (Week 6+)
2. Integrate git workflow throughout
3. Add debugging techniques explicitly
4. Emphasize command line data workflows
5. Add xkcd humor as suggested in instructor style
