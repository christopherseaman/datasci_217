Reading data and making it accessible \(often called _data loading_\) is a necessary first step for using most of the tools in this book. The term _parsing_ is also sometimes used to describe loading text data and interpreting it as tables and different data types. I’m going to focus on data input and output using pandas, though there are numerous tools in other libraries to help with reading and writing data in various formats.
Input and output typically fall into a few main categories: reading text files and other more efficient on-disk formats, loading data from databases, and interacting with network sources like web APIs.
## 6.1 Reading and Writing Data in Text Format
pandas features a number of functions for reading tabular data as a DataFrame object. Table 6.1 summarizes some of them; `pandas.read_csv` is one of the most frequently used in this book. We will look at binary data formats later in Binary Data Formats.
Table 6.1: Text and binary data loading functions in pandas Function | Description  
---|---  
`read_csv` | Load delimited data from a file, URL, or file-like object; use comma as default delimiter  
`read_fwf` | Read data in fixed-width column format \(i.e., no delimiters\)  
`read_clipboard` | Variation of `read_csv` that reads data from the clipboard; useful for converting tables from web pages  
`read_excel` | Read tabular data from an Excel XLS or XLSX file  
`read_hdf` | Read HDF5 files written by pandas  
`read_html` | Read all tables found in the given HTML document  
`read_json` | Read data from a JSON \(JavaScript Object Notation\) string representation, file, URL, or file-like object  
`read_feather` | Read the Feather binary file format  
`read_orc` | Read the Apache ORC binary file format  
`read_parquet` | Read the Apache Parquet binary file format  
`read_pickle` | Read an object stored by pandas using the Python pickle format  
`read_sas` | Read a SAS dataset stored in one of the SAS system's custom storage formats  
`read_spss` | Read a data file created by SPSS  
`read_sql` | Read the results of a SQL query \(using SQLAlchemy\)  
`read_sql_table` | Read a whole SQL table \(using SQLAlchemy\); equivalent to using a query that selects everything in that table using `read_sql`  
`read_stata` | Read a dataset from Stata file format  
`read_xml` | Read a table of data from an XML file  
I’ll give an overview of the mechanics of these functions, which are meant to convert text data into a DataFrame. The optional arguments for these functions may fall into a few categories:
Indexing
Can treat one or more columns as the returned DataFrame, and whether to get column names from the file, arguments you provide, or not at all.
Type inference and data conversion
Includes the user-defined value conversions and custom list of missing value markers.
Date and time parsing
Includes a combining capability, including combining date and time information spread over multiple columns into a single column in the result.
Iterating
Support for iterating over chunks of very large files.
Unclean data issues
Includes skipping rows or a footer, comments, or other minor things like numeric data with thousands separated by commas.
Because of how messy data in the real world can be, some of the data loading functions \(especially `pandas.read_csv`\) have accumulated a long list of optional arguments over time. It's normal to feel overwhelmed by the number of different parameters \(`pandas.read_csv` has around 50\). The online pandas documentation has many examples about how each of these works, so if you're struggling to read a particular file, there might be a similar enough example to help you find the right parameters.
Some of these functions perform _type inference_ , because the column data types are not part of the data format. That means you don’t necessarily have to specify which columns are numeric, integer, Boolean, or string. Other data formats, like HDF5, ORC, and Parquet, have the data type information embedded in the format.
Handling dates and other custom types can require extra effort.
Let’s start with a small comma-separated values \(CSV\) text file:
In [10]: !cat examples/ex1.csv
a,b,c,d,message
1,2,3,4,hello
5,6,7,8,world
9,10,11,12,foo __
__
Note 
Here I used the Unix `cat` shell command to print the raw contents of the file to the screen. If you’re on Windows, you can use `type` instead of `cat` to achieve the same effect within a Windows terminal \(or command line\).
Since this is comma-delimited, we can then use `pandas.read_csv` to read it into a DataFrame:
In [11]: df = pd.read_csv("examples/ex1.csv")
In [12]: df
Out[12]: 
a   b   c   d message
0  1   2   3   4   hello
1  5   6   7   8   world
2  9  10  11  12     foo __
A file will not always have a header row. Consider this file:
In [13]: !cat examples/ex2.csv
1,2,3,4,hello
5,6,7,8,world
9,10,11,12,foo __
To read this file, you have a couple of options. You can allow pandas to assign default column names, or you can specify names yourself:
In [14]: pd.read_csv("examples/ex2.csv", header=None)
Out[14]: 
0   1   2   3      4
0  1   2   3   4  hello
1  5   6   7   8  world
2  9  10  11  12    foo
In [15]: pd.read_csv("examples/ex2.csv", names=["a", "b", "c", "d", "message"])
Out[15]: 
a   b   c   d message
0  1   2   3   4   hello
1  5   6   7   8   world
2  9  10  11  12     foo __
Suppose you wanted the `message` column to be the index of the returned DataFrame. You can either indicate you want the column at index 4 or named `"message"` using the `index_col` argument:
In [16]: names = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "message"]
In [17]: pd.read_csv("examples/ex2.csv", names=names, index_col="message")
Out[17]: 
a   b   c   d
message               
hello    1   2   3   4
world    5   6   7   8
foo      9  10  11  12 __
If you want to form a hierarchical index \(discussed in [Ch 8.1: Hierarchical Indexing](/book/data-wrangling#pandas_hierarchical)\) from multiple columns, pass a list of column numbers or names:
In [18]: !cat examples/csv_mindex.csv
key1,key2,value1,value2
one,a,1,2
one,b,3,4
one,c,5,6
one,d,7,8
two,a,9,10
two,b,11,12
two,c,13,14
two,d,15,16
In [19]: parsed = pd.read_csv("examples/csv_mindex.csv",
....:                      index_col=["key1", "key2"])
In [20]: parsed
Out[20]: 
value1  value2
key1 key2                
one  a          1       2
b          3       4
c          5       6
d          7       8
two  a          9      10
b         11      12
c         13      14
d         15      16 __
In some cases, a table might not have a fixed delimiter, using whitespace or some other pattern to separate fields. Consider a text file that looks like this:
In [21]: !cat examples/ex3.txt
A         B         C
aaa -0.264438 -1.026059 -0.619500
bbb  0.927272  0.302904 -0.032399
ccc -0.264273 -0.386314 -0.217601
ddd -0.871858 -0.348382  1.100491 __
While you could do some munging by hand, the fields here are separated by a variable amount of whitespace. In these cases, you can pass a regular expression as a delimiter for `pandas.read_csv`. This can be expressed by the regular expression `\s+`, so we have then:
In [22]: result = pd.read_csv("examples/ex3.txt", sep="\s+")
In [23]: result
Out[23]: 
A         B         C
aaa -0.264438 -1.026059 -0.619500
bbb  0.927272  0.302904 -0.032399
ccc -0.264273 -0.386314 -0.217601
ddd -0.871858 -0.348382  1.100491 __
Because there was one fewer column name than the number of data rows, `pandas.read_csv` infers that the first column should be the DataFrame’s index in this special case.
The file parsing functions have many additional arguments to help you handle the wide variety of exception file formats that occur \(see a partial listing in Table 6.2\). For example, you can skip the first, third, and fourth rows of a file with `skiprows`:
In [24]: !cat examples/ex4.csv
# hey!
a,b,c,d,message
# just wanted to make things more difficult for you
# who reads CSV files with computers, anyway?
1,2,3,4,hello
5,6,7,8,world
9,10,11,12,foo
In [25]: pd.read_csv("examples/ex4.csv", skiprows=[0, 2, 3])
Out[25]: 
a   b   c   d message
0  1   2   3   4   hello
1  5   6   7   8   world
2  9  10  11  12     foo __
Handling missing values is an important and frequently nuanced part of the file reading process. Missing data is usually either not present \(empty string\) or marked by some _sentinel_ \(placeholder\) value. By default, pandas uses a set of commonly occurring sentinels, such as `NA` and `NULL`:
In [26]: !cat examples/ex5.csv
something,a,b,c,d,message
one,1,2,3,4,NA
two,5,6,,8,world
three,9,10,11,12,foo
In [27]: result = pd.read_csv("examples/ex5.csv")
In [28]: result
Out[28]: 
something  a   b     c   d message
0       one  1   2   3.0   4     NaN
1       two  5   6   NaN   8   world
2     three  9  10  11.0  12     foo __
Recall that pandas outputs missing values as `NaN`, so we have two null or missing values in `result`:
In [29]: pd.isna(result)
Out[29]: 
something      a      b      c      d  message
0      False  False  False  False  False     True
1      False  False  False   True  False    False
2      False  False  False  False  False    False __
The `na_values` option accepts a sequence of strings to add to the default list of strings recognized as missing:
In [30]: result = pd.read_csv("examples/ex5.csv", na_values=["NULL"])
In [31]: result
Out[31]: 
something  a   b     c   d message
0       one  1   2   3.0   4     NaN
1       two  5   6   NaN   8   world
2     three  9  10  11.0  12     foo __
`pandas.read_csv` has a list of many default NA value representations, but these defaults can be disabled with the `keep_default_na` option:
In [32]: result2 = pd.read_csv("examples/ex5.csv", keep_default_na=False)
In [33]: result2
Out[33]: 
something  a   b   c   d message
0       one  1   2   3   4      NA
1       two  5   6       8   world
2     three  9  10  11  12     foo
In [34]: result2.isna()
Out[34]: 
something      a      b      c      d  message
0      False  False  False  False  False    False
1      False  False  False  False  False    False
2      False  False  False  False  False    False
In [35]: result3 = pd.read_csv("examples/ex5.csv", keep_default_na=False,
....:                       na_values=["NA"])
In [36]: result3
Out[36]: 
something  a   b   c   d message
0       one  1   2   3   4     NaN
1       two  5   6       8   world
2     three  9  10  11  12     foo
In [37]: result3.isna()
Out[37]: 
something      a      b      c      d  message
0      False  False  False  False  False     True
1      False  False  False  False  False    False
2      False  False  False  False  False    False __
Different NA sentinels can be specified for each column in a dictionary:
In [38]: sentinels = {"message": ["foo", "NA"], "something": ["two"]}
In [39]: pd.read_csv("examples/ex5.csv", na_values=sentinels,
....:             keep_default_na=False)
Out[39]: 
something  a   b   c   d message
0       one  1   2   3   4     NaN
1       NaN  5   6       8   world
2     three  9  10  11  12     NaN __
Table 6.2 lists some frequently used options in `pandas.read_csv`.
Table 6.2: Some `pandas.read_csv` function arguments Argument | Description  
---|---  
`path` | String indicating filesystem location, URL, or file-like object.  
`sep` or `delimiter` | Character sequence or regular expression to use to split fields in each row.  
`header` | Row number to use as column names; defaults to 0 \(first row\), but should be `None` if there is no header row.  
`index_col` | Column numbers or names to use as the row index in the result; can be a single name/number or a list of them for a hierarchical index.  
`names` | List of column names for result.  
`skiprows` | Number of rows at beginning of file to ignore or list of row numbers \(starting from 0\) to skip.  
`na_values` | Sequence of values to replace with NA. They are added to the default list unless `keep_default_na=False` is passed.  
`keep_default_na` | Whether to use the default NA value list or not \(`True` by default\).  
`comment` | Character\(s\) to split comments off the end of lines.  
`parse_dates` | Attempt to parse data to `datetime`; `False` by default. If `True`, will attempt to parse all columns. Otherwise, can specify a list of column numbers or names to parse. If element of list is tuple or list, will combine multiple columns together and parse to date \(e.g., if date/time split across two columns\).  
`keep_date_col` | If joining columns to parse date, keep the joined columns; `False` by default.  
`converters` | Dictionary containing column number or name mapping to functions \(e.g., `{"foo": f}` would apply the function `f` to all values in the `"foo"` column\).  
`dayfirst` | When parsing potentially ambiguous dates, treat as international format \(e.g., 7/6/2012 -> June 7, 2012\); `False` by default.  
`date_parser` | Function to use to parse dates.  
`nrows` | Number of rows to read from beginning of file \(not counting the header\).  
`iterator` | Return a `TextFileReader` object for reading the file piecemeal. This object can also be used with the `with` statement.  
`chunksize` | For iteration, size of file chunks.  
`skip_footer` | Number of lines to ignore at end of file.  
`verbose` | Print various parsing information, like the time spent in each stage of the file conversion and memory use information.  
`encoding` | Text encoding \(e.g., `"utf-8` for UTF-8 encoded text\). Defaults to `"utf-8"` if `None`.  
`squeeze` | If the parsed data contains only one column, return a Series.  
`thousands` | Separator for thousands \(e.g., `","` or `"."`\); default is `None`.  
`decimal` | Decimal separator in numbers \(e.g., `"."` or `","`\); default is `"."`.  
`engine` | CSV parsing and conversion engine to use; can be one of `"c"`, `"python"`, or `"pyarrow"`. The default is `"c"`, though the newer `"pyarrow"` engine can parse some files much faster. The `"python"` engine is slower but supports some features that the other engines do not.  
### Reading Text Files in Pieces
When processing very large files or figuring out the right set of arguments to correctly process a large file, you may want to read only a small piece of a file or iterate through smaller chunks of the file.
Before we look at a large file, we make the pandas display settings more compact:
In [40]: pd.options.display.max_rows = 10 __
Now we have:
In [41]: result = pd.read_csv("examples/ex6.csv")
In [42]: result
Out[42]: 
one       two     three      four key
0     0.467976 -0.038649 -0.295344 -1.824726   L
1    -0.358893  1.404453  0.704965 -0.200638   B
2    -0.501840  0.659254 -0.421691 -0.057688   G
3     0.204886  1.074134  1.388361 -0.982404   R
4     0.354628 -0.133116  0.283763 -0.837063   Q
...        ...       ...       ...       ...  ..
9995  2.311896 -0.417070 -1.409599 -0.515821   L
9996 -0.479893 -0.650419  0.745152 -0.646038   E
9997  0.523331  0.787112  0.486066  1.093156   K
9998 -0.362559  0.598894 -1.843201  0.887292   G
9999 -0.096376 -1.012999 -0.657431 -0.573315   0
[10000 rows x 5 columns]__
The elipsis marks `...` indicate that rows in the middle of the DataFrame have been omitted.
If you want to read only a small number of rows \(avoiding reading the entire file\), specify that with `nrows`:
In [43]: pd.read_csv("examples/ex6.csv", nrows=5)
Out[43]: 
one       two     three      four key
0  0.467976 -0.038649 -0.295344 -1.824726   L
1 -0.358893  1.404453  0.704965 -0.200638   B
2 -0.501840  0.659254 -0.421691 -0.057688   G
3  0.204886  1.074134  1.388361 -0.982404   R
4  0.354628 -0.133116  0.283763 -0.837063   Q __
To read a file in pieces, specify a `chunksize` as a number of rows:
In [44]: chunker = pd.read_csv("examples/ex6.csv", chunksize=1000)
In [45]: type(chunker)
Out[45]: pandas.io.parsers.readers.TextFileReader __
The `TextFileReader` object returned by `pandas.read_csv` allows you to iterate over the parts of the file according to the `chunksize`. For example, we can iterate over `ex6.csv`, aggregating the value counts in the `"key"` column, like so:
chunker = pd.read_csv("examples/ex6.csv", chunksize=1000)
tot = pd.Series([], dtype='int64')
for piece in chunker:
tot = tot.add(piece["key"].value_counts(), fill_value=0)
tot = tot.sort_values(ascending=False)__
We have then:
In [47]: tot[:10]
Out[47]: 
key
E    368.0
X    364.0
L    346.0
O    343.0
Q    340.0
M    338.0
J    337.0
F    335.0
K    334.0
H    330.0
dtype: float64 __
`TextFileReader` is also equipped with a `get_chunk` method that enables you to read pieces of an arbitrary size.
### Writing Data to Text Format
Data can also be exported to a delimited format. Let’s consider one of the CSV files read before:
In [48]: data = pd.read_csv("examples/ex5.csv")
In [49]: data
Out[49]: 
something  a   b     c   d message
0       one  1   2   3.0   4     NaN
1       two  5   6   NaN   8   world
2     three  9  10  11.0  12     foo __
Using DataFrame’s `to_csv` method, we can write the data out to a comma-separated file:
In [50]: data.to_csv("examples/out.csv")
In [51]: !cat examples/out.csv
,something,a,b,c,d,message
0,one,1,2,3.0,4,
1,two,5,6,,8,world
2,three,9,10,11.0,12,foo __
Other delimiters can be used, of course \(writing to `sys.stdout` so it prints the text result to the console rather than a file\):
In [52]: import sys
In [53]: data.to_csv(sys.stdout, sep="|")
|something|a|b|c|d|message
0|one|1|2|3.0|4|
1|two|5|6||8|world
2|three|9|10|11.0|12|foo __
Missing values appear as empty strings in the output. You might want to denote them by some other sentinel value:
In [54]: data.to_csv(sys.stdout, na_rep="NULL")
,something,a,b,c,d,message
0,one,1,2,3.0,4,NULL
1,two,5,6,NULL,8,world
2,three,9,10,11.0,12,foo __
With no other options specified, both the row and column labels are written. Both of these can be disabled:
In [55]: data.to_csv(sys.stdout, index=False, header=False)
one,1,2,3.0,4,
two,5,6,,8,world
three,9,10,11.0,12,foo __
You can also write only a subset of the columns, and in an order of your choosing:
In [56]: data.to_csv(sys.stdout, index=False, columns=["a", "b", "c"])
a,b,c
1,2,3.0
5,6,
9,10,11.0 __
### Working with Other Delimited Formats
It's possible to load most forms of tabular data from disk using functions like `pandas.read_csv`. In some cases, however, some manual processing may be necessary. It’s not uncommon to receive a file with one or more malformed lines that trip up `pandas.read_csv`. To illustrate the basic tools, consider a small CSV file:
In [57]: !cat examples/ex7.csv
"a","b","c"
"1","2","3"
"1","2","3"__
For any file with a single-character delimiter, you can use Python’s built-in `csv` module. To use it, pass any open file or file-like object to `csv.reader`:
In [58]: import csv
In [59]: f = open("examples/ex7.csv")
In [60]: reader = csv.reader(f)__
Iterating through the reader like a file yields lists of values with any quote characters removed:
In [61]: for line in reader:
....:     print(line)
['a', 'b', 'c']
['1', '2', '3']
['1', '2', '3']
In [62]: f.close()__
From there, it’s up to you to do the wrangling necessary to put the data in the form that you need. Let's take this step by step. First, we read the file into a list of lines:
In [63]: with open("examples/ex7.csv") as f:
....:     lines = list(csv.reader(f))__
Then we split the lines into the header line and the data lines:
In [64]: header, values = lines[0], lines[1:]__
Then we can create a dictionary of data columns using a dictionary comprehension and the expression `zip(*values)` \(beware that this will use a lot of memory on large files\), which transposes rows to columns:
In [65]: data_dict = {h: v for h, v in zip(header, zip(*values))}
In [66]: data_dict
Out[66]: {'a': ('1', '1'), 'b': ('2', '2'), 'c': ('3', '3')}__
CSV files come in many different flavors. To define a new format with a different delimiter, string quoting convention, or line terminator, we could define a simple subclass of `csv.Dialect`:
class my_dialect(csv.Dialect):
lineterminator = "\n"
delimiter = ";"
quotechar = '"'
quoting = csv.QUOTE_MINIMAL __
reader = csv.reader(f, dialect=my_dialect)__
We could also give individual CSV dialect parameters as keywords to `csv.reader` without having to define a subclass:
reader = csv.reader(f, delimiter="|")__
The possible options \(attributes of `csv.Dialect`\) and what they do can be found in Table 6.3.
Table 6.3: CSV `dialect` options Argument | Description  
---|---  
`delimiter` | One-character string to separate fields; defaults to `","`.  
`lineterminator` | Line terminator for writing; defaults to `"\r\n"`. Reader ignores this and recognizes cross-platform line terminators.  
`quotechar` | Quote character for fields with special characters \(like a delimiter\); default is `'"'`.  
`quoting` | Quoting convention. Options include `csv.QUOTE_ALL` \(quote all fields\), `csv.QUOTE_MINIMAL` \(only fields with special characters like the delimiter\), `csv.QUOTE_NONNUMERIC`, and `csv.QUOTE_NONE` \(no quoting\). See Python’s documentation for full details. Defaults to `QUOTE_MINIMAL`.  
`skipinitialspace` | Ignore whitespace after each delimiter; default is `False`.  
`doublequote` | How to handle quoting character inside a field; if `True`, it is doubled \(see online documentation for full detail and behavior\).  
`escapechar` | String to escape the delimiter if `quoting` is set to `csv.QUOTE_NONE`; disabled by default.  
__
Note 
For files with more complicated or fixed multicharacter delimiters, you will not be able to use the `csv` module. In those cases, you’ll have to do the line splitting and other cleanup using the string’s `split` method or the regular expression method `re.split`. Thankfully, `pandas.read_csv` is capable of doing almost anything you need if you pass the necessary options, so you only rarely will have to parse files by hand.
To _write_ delimited files manually, you can use `csv.writer`. It accepts an open, writable file object and the same dialect and format options as `csv.reader`:
with open("mydata.csv", "w") as f:
writer = csv.writer(f, dialect=my_dialect)
writer.writerow(("one", "two", "three"))
writer.writerow(("1", "2", "3"))
writer.writerow(("4", "5", "6"))
writer.writerow(("7", "8", "9"))__
### JSON Data
JSON \(short for JavaScript Object Notation\) has become one of the standard formats for sending data by HTTP request between web browsers and other applications. It is a much more free-form data format than a tabular text form like CSV. Here is an example:
obj = """
{"name": "Wes",
"cities_lived": ["Akron", "Nashville", "New York", "San Francisco"],
"pet": null,
"siblings": [{"name": "Scott", "age": 34, "hobbies": ["guitars", "soccer"]},
{"name": "Katie", "age": 42, "hobbies": ["diving", "art"]}]
}
"""__
JSON is very nearly valid Python code with the exception of its null value `null` and some other nuances \(such as disallowing trailing commas at the end of lists\). The basic types are objects \(dictionaries\), arrays \(lists\), strings, numbers, Booleans, and nulls. All of the keys in an object must be strings. There are several Python libraries for reading and writing JSON data. I’ll use `json` here, as it is built into the Python standard library. To convert a JSON string to Python form, use `json.loads`:
In [68]: import json
In [69]: result = json.loads(obj)
In [70]: result
Out[70]: 
{'name': 'Wes',
'cities_lived': ['Akron', 'Nashville', 'New York', 'San Francisco'],
'pet': None,
'siblings': [{'name': 'Scott',
'age': 34,
'hobbies': ['guitars', 'soccer']},
{'name': 'Katie', 'age': 42, 'hobbies': ['diving', 'art']}]}__
`json.dumps`, on the other hand, converts a Python object back to JSON:
In [71]: asjson = json.dumps(result)
In [72]: asjson
Out[72]: '{"name": "Wes", "cities_lived": ["Akron", "Nashville", "New York", "San
Francisco"], "pet": null, "siblings": [{"name": "Scott", "age": 34, "hobbies": [
"guitars", "soccer"]}, {"name": "Katie", "age": 42, "hobbies": ["diving", "art"]}
]}'__
How you convert a JSON object or list of objects to a DataFrame or some other data structure for analysis will be up to you. Conveniently, you can pass a list of dictionaries \(which were previously JSON objects\) to the DataFrame constructor and select a subset of the data fields:
In [73]: siblings = pd.DataFrame(result["siblings"], columns=["name", "age"])
In [74]: siblings
Out[74]: 
name  age
0  Scott   34
1  Katie   42 __
The `pandas.read_json` can automatically convert JSON datasets in specific arrangements into a Series or DataFrame. For example:
In [75]: !cat examples/example.json
[{"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3},
{"a": 4, "b": 5, "c": 6},
{"a": 7, "b": 8, "c": 9}]__
The default options for `pandas.read_json` assume that each object in the JSON array is a row in the table:
In [76]: data = pd.read_json("examples/example.json")
In [77]: data
Out[77]: 
a  b  c
0  1  2  3
1  4  5  6
2  7  8  9 __
For an extended example of reading and manipulating JSON data \(including nested records\), see the USDA food database example in Ch 13: Data Analysis Examples.
If you need to export data from pandas to JSON, one way is to use the `to_json` methods on Series and DataFrame:
In [78]: data.to_json(sys.stdout)
{"a":{"0":1,"1":4,"2":7},"b":{"0":2,"1":5,"2":8},"c":{"0":3,"1":6,"2":9}}
In [79]: data.to_json(sys.stdout, orient="records")
[{"a":1,"b":2,"c":3},{"a":4,"b":5,"c":6},{"a":7,"b":8,"c":9}]__
### XML and HTML: Web Scraping
Python has many libraries for reading and writing data in the ubiquitous HTML and XML formats. Examples include lxml, Beautiful Soup, and html5lib. While lxml is comparatively much faster in general, the other libraries can better handle malformed HTML or XML files.
pandas has a built-in function, `pandas.read_html`, which uses all of these libraries to automatically parse tables out of HTML files as DataFrame objects. To show how this works, I downloaded an HTML file \(used in the pandas documentation\) from the US FDIC showing bank failures.1 First, you must install some additional libraries used by `read_html`:
conda install lxml beautifulsoup4 html5lib
If you are not using conda, `pip install lxml` should also work.
The `pandas.read_html` function has a number of options, but by default it searches for and attempts to parse all tabular data contained within `<table>` tags. The result is a list of DataFrame objects:
In [80]: tables = pd.read_html("examples/fdic_failed_bank_list.html")
In [81]: len(tables)
Out[81]: 1
In [82]: failures = tables[0]
In [83]: failures.head()
Out[83]: 
Bank Name             City  ST   CERT   
0                   Allied Bank         Mulberry  AR     91  \

2        First CornerStone Bank  King of Prussia  PA  35312   
3            Trust Company Bank          Memphis  TN   9956   
4    North Milwaukee State Bank        Milwaukee  WI  20364   
Acquiring Institution        Closing Date       Updated Date

1                          United Bank     August 19, 2016  November 17, 2016  
2  First-Citizens Bank & Trust Company         May 6, 2016  September 6, 2016  
3           The Bank of Fayette County      April 29, 2016  September 6, 2016  
4  First-Citizens Bank & Trust Company      March 11, 2016      June 16, 2016  __
Because `failures` has many columns, pandas inserts a line break character `\`.
As you will learn in later chapters, from here we could proceed to do some data cleaning and analysis, like computing the number of bank failures by year:
In [84]: close_timestamps = pd.to_datetime(failures["Closing Date"])
In [85]: close_timestamps.dt.year.value_counts()
Out[85]: 
Closing Date

#### Parsing XML with lxml.objectify
XML is another common structured data format supporting hierarchical, nested data with metadata. The book you are currently reading was actually created from a series of large XML documents.
Earlier, I showed the `pandas.read_html` function, which uses either lxml or Beautiful Soup under the hood to parse data from HTML. XML and HTML are structurally similar, but XML is more general. Here, I will show an example of how to use lxml to parse data from a more general XML format.
For many years, the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority \(MTA\) published a number of data series about its bus and train services in XML format. Here we’ll look at the performance data, which is contained in a set of XML files. Each train or bus service has a different file \(like _Performance\_MNR.xml_ for the Metro-North Railroad\) containing monthly data as a series of XML records that look like this:
<INDICATOR>
<INDICATOR_SEQ>373889</INDICATOR_SEQ>
<PARENT_SEQ></PARENT_SEQ>
<AGENCY_NAME>Metro-North Railroad</AGENCY_NAME>
<INDICATOR_NAME>Escalator Availability</INDICATOR_NAME>
<DESCRIPTION>Percent of the time that escalators are operational
systemwide. The availability rate is based on physical observations performed
the morning of regular business days only. This is a new indicator the agency
began reporting in 2009.</DESCRIPTION>
<PERIOD_YEAR>2011</PERIOD_YEAR>
<PERIOD_MONTH>12</PERIOD_MONTH>
<CATEGORY>Service Indicators</CATEGORY>
<FREQUENCY>M</FREQUENCY>
<DESIRED_CHANGE>U</DESIRED_CHANGE>
<INDICATOR_UNIT>%</INDICATOR_UNIT>
<DECIMAL_PLACES>1</DECIMAL_PLACES>
<YTD_TARGET>97.00</YTD_TARGET>
<YTD_ACTUAL></YTD_ACTUAL>
<MONTHLY_TARGET>97.00</MONTHLY_TARGET>
<MONTHLY_ACTUAL></MONTHLY_ACTUAL>
</INDICATOR>__
Using `lxml.objectify`, we parse the file and get a reference to the root node of the XML file with `getroot`:
In [86]: from lxml import objectify
In [87]: path = "datasets/mta_perf/Performance_MNR.xml"
In [88]: with open(path) as f:
....:     parsed = objectify.parse(f)
In [89]: root = parsed.getroot()__
`root.INDICATOR` returns a generator yielding each `<INDICATOR>` XML element. For each record, we can populate a dictionary of tag names \(like `YTD_ACTUAL`\) to data values \(excluding a few tags\) by running the following code:
data = []
skip_fields = ["PARENT_SEQ", "INDICATOR_SEQ",
"DESIRED_CHANGE", "DECIMAL_PLACES"]
for elt in root.INDICATOR:
el_data = {}
for child in elt.getchildren():
if child.tag in skip_fields:
continue
el_data[child.tag] = child.pyval
data.append(el_data)__
Lastly, convert this list of dictionaries into a DataFrame:
In [91]: perf = pd.DataFrame(data)
In [92]: perf.head()
Out[92]:

For more complex XML documents, refer to the docstring for `pandas.read_xml` which describes how to do selections and filters to extract a particular table of interest.
## 6.2 Binary Data Formats
One simple way to store \(or _serialize_\) data in binary format is using Python’s built-in `pickle` module. pandas objects all have a `to_pickle` method that writes the data to disk in pickle format:
In [95]: frame = pd.read_csv("examples/ex1.csv")
In [96]: frame
Out[96]: 
a   b   c   d message
0  1   2   3   4   hello
1  5   6   7   8   world
2  9  10  11  12     foo
In [97]: frame.to_pickle("examples/frame_pickle")__
Pickle files are in general readable only in Python. You can read any "pickled" object stored in a file by using the built-in `pickle` directly, or even more conveniently using `pandas.read_pickle`:
In [98]: pd.read_pickle("examples/frame_pickle")
Out[98]: 
a   b   c   d message
0  1   2   3   4   hello
1  5   6   7   8   world
2  9  10  11  12     foo __
__
Caution 
`pickle` is recommended only as a short-term storage format. The problem is that it is hard to guarantee that the format will be stable over time; an object pickled today may not unpickle with a later version of a library. pandas has tried to maintain backward compatibility when possible, but at some point in the future it may be necessary to “break” the pickle format.
pandas has built-in support for several other open source binary data formats, such as HDF5, ORC, and Apache Parquet. For example, if you install the `pyarrow` package \(`conda install pyarrow`\), then you can read Parquet files with `pandas.read_parquet`:
In [100]: fec = pd.read_parquet('datasets/fec/fec.parquet')__
I will give some HDF5 examples in Using HDF5 Format. I encourage you to explore different file formats to see how fast they are and how well they work for your analysis.
### Reading Microsoft Excel Files
pandas also supports reading tabular data stored in Excel 2003 \(and higher\) files using either the `pandas.ExcelFile` class or `pandas.read_excel` function. Internally, these tools use the add-on packages `xlrd` and `openpyxl` to read old-style XLS and newer XLSX files, respectively. These must be installed separately from pandas using pip or conda:
conda install openpyxl xlrd
To use `pandas.ExcelFile`, create an instance by passing a path to an `xls` or `xlsx` file:
In [101]: xlsx = pd.ExcelFile("examples/ex1.xlsx")__
This object can show you the list of available sheet names in the file:
In [102]: xlsx.sheet_names
Out[102]: ['Sheet1']__
Data stored in a sheet can then be read into DataFrame with `parse`:
In [103]: xlsx.parse(sheet_name="Sheet1")
Out[103]: 
Unnamed: 0  a   b   c   d message
0           0  1   2   3   4   hello
1           1  5   6   7   8   world
2           2  9  10  11  12     foo __
This Excel table has an index column, so we can indicate that with the `index_col` argument:
In [104]: xlsx.parse(sheet_name="Sheet1", index_col=0)
Out[104]: 
a   b   c   d message
0  1   2   3   4   hello
1  5   6   7   8   world
2  9  10  11  12     foo __
If you are reading multiple sheets in a file, then it is faster to create the `pandas.ExcelFile`, but you can also simply pass the filename to `pandas.read_excel`:
In [105]: frame = pd.read_excel("examples/ex1.xlsx", sheet_name="Sheet1")
In [106]: frame
Out[106]: 
Unnamed: 0  a   b   c   d message
0           0  1   2   3   4   hello
1           1  5   6   7   8   world
2           2  9  10  11  12     foo __
To write pandas data to Excel format, you must first create an `ExcelWriter`, then write data to it using the pandas object's `to_excel` method:
In [107]: writer = pd.ExcelWriter("examples/ex2.xlsx")
In [108]: frame.to_excel(writer, "Sheet1")
In [109]: writer.close()__
You can also pass a file path to `to_excel` and avoid the `ExcelWriter`:
In [110]: frame.to_excel("examples/ex2.xlsx")__
### Using HDF5 Format
HDF5 is a respected file format intended for storing large quantities of scientific array data. It is available as a C library, and it has interfaces available in many other languages, including Java, Julia, MATLAB, and Python. The “HDF” in HDF5 stands for _hierarchical data format_. Each HDF5 file can store multiple datasets and supporting metadata. Compared with simpler formats, HDF5 supports on-the-fly compression with a variety of compression modes, enabling data with repeated patterns to be stored more efficiently. HDF5 can be a good choice for working with datasets that don't fit into memory, as you can efficiently read and write small sections of much larger arrays.
To get started with HDF5 and pandas, you must first install PyTables by installing the `tables` package with conda:
conda install pytables
__
Note 
Note that the PyTables package is called "tables" in PyPI, so if you install with pip you will have to run `pip install tables`.
While it's possible to directly access HDF5 files using either the PyTables or h5py libraries, pandas provides a high-level interface that simplifies storing Series and DataFrame objects. The `HDFStore` class works like a dictionary and handles the low-level details:
In [113]: frame = pd.DataFrame({"a": np.random.standard_normal(100)})
In [114]: store = pd.HDFStore("examples/mydata.h5")
In [115]: store["obj1"] = frame
In [116]: store["obj1_col"] = frame["a"]
In [117]: store
Out[117]: 
<class 'pandas.io.pytables.HDFStore'>
File path: examples/mydata.h5 __
Objects contained in the HDF5 file can then be retrieved with the same dictionary-like API:
In [118]: store["obj1"]
Out[118]: 
a
0  -0.204708
1   0.478943
2  -0.519439
3  -0.555730
4   1.965781
..       ...
95  0.795253
96  0.118110
97 -0.748532
98  0.584970
99  0.152677
[100 rows x 1 columns]__
`HDFStore` supports two storage schemas, `"fixed"` and `"table"` \(the default is `"fixed"`\). The latter is generally slower, but it supports query operations using a special syntax:
In [119]: store.put("obj2", frame, format="table")
In [120]: store.select("obj2", where=["index >= 10 and index <= 15"])
Out[120]: 
a
10  1.007189
11 -1.296221
12  0.274992
13  0.228913
14  1.352917
15  0.886429
In [121]: store.close()__
The `put` is an explicit version of the `store["obj2"] = frame` method but allows us to set other options like the storage format.
The `pandas.read_hdf` function gives you a shortcut to these tools:
In [122]: frame.to_hdf("examples/mydata.h5", "obj3", format="table")
In [123]: pd.read_hdf("examples/mydata.h5", "obj3", where=["index < 5"])
Out[123]: 
a
0 -0.204708
1  0.478943
2 -0.519439
3 -0.555730
4  1.965781 __
If you'd like, you can delete the HDF5 file you created, like so:
In [124]: import os
In [125]: os.remove("examples/mydata.h5")__
__
Note 
If you are processing data that is stored on remote servers, like Amazon S3 or HDFS, using a different binary format designed for distributed storage like [Apache Parquet](http://parquet.apache.org) may be more suitable.
If you work with large quantities of data locally, I would encourage you to explore PyTables and h5py to see how they can suit your needs. Since many data analysis problems are I/O-bound \(rather than CPU-bound\), using a tool like HDF5 can massively accelerate your applications.
__
Caution 
HDF5 is _not_ a database. It is best suited for write-once, read-many datasets. While data can be added to a file at any time, if multiple writers do so simultaneously, the file can become corrupted.
## 6.3 Interacting with Web APIs
Many websites have public APIs providing data feeds via JSON or some other format. There are a number of ways to access these APIs from Python; one method that I recommend is the [`requests` package](http://docs.python-requests.org), which can be installed with pip or conda:
conda install requests
To find the last 30 GitHub issues for pandas on GitHub, we can make a `GET` HTTP request using the add-on `requests` library:
In [126]: import requests
In [127]: url = "https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas/issues"
In [128]: resp = requests.get(url)
In [129]: resp.raise_for_status()
In [130]: resp
Out[130]: <Response [200]>__
It's a good practice to always call `raise_for_status` after using `requests.get` to check for HTTP errors.
The response object’s `json` method will return a Python object containing the parsed JSON data as a dictionary or list \(depending on what JSON is returned\):
In [131]: data = resp.json()
In [132]: data[0]["title"]
Out[132]: 'BUG: DataFrame.pivot mutates empty index.name attribute with typing._L
iteralGenericAlias'__
Since the results retrieved are based on real-time data, what you see when you run this code will almost definitely be different.
Each element in `data` is a dictionary containing all of the data found on a GitHub issue page \(except for the comments\). We can pass `data` directly to `pandas.DataFrame` and extract fields of interest:
In [133]: issues = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=["number", "title",
.....:                                      "labels", "state"])
In [134]: issues

With a bit of elbow grease, you can create some higher-level interfaces to common web APIs that return DataFrame objects for more convenient analysis.
## 6.4 Interacting with Databases
In a business setting, a lot of data may not be stored in text or Excel files. SQL-based relational databases \(such as SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and MySQL\) are in wide use, and many alternative databases have become quite popular. The choice of database is usually dependent on the performance, data integrity, and scalability needs of an application.
pandas has some functions to simplify loading the results of a SQL query into a DataFrame. As an example, I’ll create a SQLite3 database using Python’s built-in `sqlite3` driver:
In [135]: import sqlite3
In [136]: query = """
.....: CREATE TABLE test
.....: (a VARCHAR(20), b VARCHAR(20),
.....:  c REAL,        d INTEGER
.....: );"""
In [137]: con = sqlite3.connect("mydata.sqlite")
In [138]: con.execute(query)
Out[138]: <sqlite3.Cursor at 0x188e40ac0>
In [139]: con.commit()__
Then, insert a few rows of data:
In [140]: data = [("Atlanta", "Georgia", 1.25, 6),
.....:         ("Tallahassee", "Florida", 2.6, 3),
.....:         ("Sacramento", "California", 1.7, 5)]
In [141]: stmt = "INSERT INTO test VALUES(?, ?, ?, ?)"
In [142]: con.executemany(stmt, data)
Out[142]: <sqlite3.Cursor at 0x188ed02c0>
In [143]: con.commit()__
Most Python SQL drivers return a list of tuples when selecting data from a table:
In [144]: cursor = con.execute("SELECT * FROM test")
In [145]: rows = cursor.fetchall()
In [146]: rows
Out[146]: 
[('Atlanta', 'Georgia', 1.25, 6),
('Tallahassee', 'Florida', 2.6, 3),
('Sacramento', 'California', 1.7, 5)]__
You can pass the list of tuples to the DataFrame constructor, but you also need the column names, contained in the cursor’s `description` attribute. Note that for SQLite3, the cursor `description` only provides column names \(the other fields, which are part of Python's Database API specification, are `None`\), but for some other database drivers, more column information is provided:
In [147]: cursor.description
Out[147]: 
(('a', None, None, None, None, None, None),
('b', None, None, None, None, None, None),
('c', None, None, None, None, None, None),
('d', None, None, None, None, None, None))
In [148]: pd.DataFrame(rows, columns=[x[0] for x in cursor.description])
Out[148]: 
a           b     c  d
0      Atlanta     Georgia  1.25  6
1  Tallahassee     Florida  2.60  3
2   Sacramento  California  1.70  5 __
This is quite a bit of munging that you’d rather not repeat each time you query the database. The [SQLAlchemy project](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is a popular Python SQL toolkit that abstracts away many of the common differences between SQL databases. pandas has a `read_sql` function that enables you to read data easily from a general SQLAlchemy connection. You can install SQLAlchemy with conda like so:
conda install sqlalchemy
Now, we'll connect to the same SQLite database with SQLAlchemy and read data from the table created before:
In [149]: import sqlalchemy as sqla
In [150]: db = sqla.create_engine("sqlite:///mydata.sqlite")
In [151]: pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM test", db)
Out[151]: 
a           b     c  d
0      Atlanta     Georgia  1.25  6
1  Tallahassee     Florida  2.60  3
2   Sacramento  California  1.70  5 __
## 6.5 Conclusion
Getting access to data is frequently the first step in the data analysis process. We have looked at a number of useful tools in this chapter that should help you get started. In the upcoming chapters we will dig deeper into data wrangling, data visualization, time series analysis, and other topics.
